# Visual Knowledge Discovery and Imaging Lab

Welcome to the Visual Knowledge Discovery and Imaging Lab, directed by Dr. Boris Kovalerchuk. We are located at the department of Computer Science at Central Washington University. Our lab focuses on Visual Knowledge Discovery and Machine Learning from inherently interpretable visual paradigms. We use methodologies and insights that have been detailed in foundational works such as Dr. Kovalerchuk's book, "Visual Knowledge Discovery and Machine Learning" (2018).  

This GitHub organization contains research projects conducted by students under the guidance of Dr. Boris Kovalerchuk, contributing to the field of high-dimensional data visualization and machine learning techniques for identifying complex multidimensional data patterns. For more information please see [Dr. Kovalerchuk's publications](https://borisk.dreamhosters.com/public_html/).
