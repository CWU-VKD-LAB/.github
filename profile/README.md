# Central Washington University Visual Knowledge Discovery and Imaging Lab

Welcome to the Central Washington University Visual Knowledge Discovery and Imaging Lab, led by Dr. Boris Kovalerchuk. Our lab focuses on Visual Knowledge Discovery and Machine Learning from inherently interpretable visual paradigms, leveraging methodologies and insights that have been detailed in foundational works such as Dr. Kovalerchuk's book, "Visual Knowledge Discovery and Machine Learning" (2018).  

This GitHub organization contains research projects conducted by students under the guidance of Dr. Boris Kovalerchuk, contributing to the field of high-dimensional data visualization and machine learning techniques for identifying complex multidimensional data patterns.
